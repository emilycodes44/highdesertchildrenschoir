            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                The High Desert Children's Choir provides opportunities for children to develop their musical talents and share their voices with the community. We welcome children aged 4 and above, and our rehearsals are held every Thursday from 5-7pm at the Victor Valley Church in Hesperia, CA. We are actively accepting new members and have been performing at local events throughout the High Desert region, including our recent performance at the Christmas tree lighting event in Lucerne Valley in December 2024.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our director, Ella, is passionate about teaching children to sing and has seen significant development in the children who have participated in our program. Scholarships are available for those who are interested in joining, ensuring that all children have the opportunity to experience the joy of music.
